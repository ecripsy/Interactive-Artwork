I lost the original file for the code but this is the tutorial I followed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1HEwgHSBrs

I used the english dubbed voice of Sloth from RE:Zero for the audio

The coding is pretty basic as from the moment it's plugged in, it will begin to make the noise. It will continue to loop untill unplugged.

The breadboard and arduino was stored in a plastic take out box stuffed into the head and sew up.
